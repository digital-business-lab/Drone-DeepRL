### Environments
I think for the environments and the model to learn good it is best to split the task into several different environments.
1. Create an environment so the drone gets from point A to point B on a flat ground.
2. Create an environment so the drone learns basic flying. Let it from point A to point B and then return to point A.
3. Create an environment so the drone learns to avoid objects. Create an environment with different objects that should not be touched. Point A and B should be apart and in the air.
